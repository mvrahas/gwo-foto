## About

An 3D interactive web experience with educational content about a healthcare non-profit in Jeremie, Haiti.

The experience centers around a 3D interactive map of the city of Jeremie, Haiti. Users can click different parts of the map to jump to different 3D scenes and engage with video and other interactive content about the non-profit. The experience was designed to be immersive, engaging, and interesting.

I built this project as the thesis for my degree in Media Arts + Practice. All of the content in the experience is original, created by me and the many people I collaborated with to make the project a reality.
